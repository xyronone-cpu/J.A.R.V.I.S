"""
JARVIS plugin — Quiz me.

"Test me on the French subjunctive", "ask me five questions about what's in
this PDF", "quiz me on yesterday's chemistry chapter". JARVIS puts the questions
on screen, you answer them at your own pace, and it tells you how you did.

WHO WRITES THE QUESTIONS — and why it matters
---------------------------------------------
JARVIS does, in the same breath it calls this tool. The questions arrive as the
`questions` argument, already written by the model that is mid-conversation with
you. This plugin never calls an API of its own.

That is a deliberate choice, not a shortcut. Generating questions with a
separate text model would spend a request per quiz against a daily quota, add
seconds of latency, and throw away everything the assistant already knows — your
level, your language, the file you just dropped in, what you got wrong last
week. Passing them through as tool arguments costs nothing extra and keeps all
of it.

IT DOES NOT BLOCK
-----------------
`start` puts the questions on the board and returns immediately. A tool call
that waited for a human to finish a quiz would sit there for minutes and time
out. When you finish, the UI hands the results back to JARVIS as a new message,
exactly the way a dropped file does — so the marking, the encouragement, and the
decision to remember any of it happen in normal conversation, in your language.

IT KEEPS NO STORE OF ITS OWN
----------------------------
No quiz_history.json, no per-plugin database. What is worth carrying between
sessions goes where everything else about you goes — long-term memory, through
the same save_memory JARVIS uses for anything else, and only when there is real
continuity to carry: you are working through a language, you keep losing the
same tense. A score from one Tuesday is not that.

That is a rule about the whole app, not about this plugin. Long-term memory is
what makes one person's JARVIS different from another's, and it takes its shape
from what they actually do. If every plugin opened a private file beside it, the
interesting part would be scattered across a dozen of them and JARVIS would know
less about you, not more.

FOR EVERYONE: no keys, no setup, no dependencies beyond the standard library,
same on Windows, macOS and Linux. Language-agnostic — answers are compared after
Unicode normalisation rather than through any per-language table, and anything
the comparison is unsure about is handed to JARVIS to judge rather than being
marked wrong.
